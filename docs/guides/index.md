# Guides
There aren't any guides yet. But when there are, they'll be listed here.

### Contributing
If you'd like to write a guide, you can make a [pull request](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine/pulls). Make sure you put the guide in `docs/guides/` and that it's written in Markdown.

Guides that need to be written:
- How to use the charting state/chart editor
- How to make custom weeks
- How to make custom dialogue (like Week 6)
- How to make custom characters
